# DP-PIMD: Run path intagral molecular dynamics (PIMD) calculations with DeePMD-kit and LAMMPS.

This repo describes how DeepMD-kit can be used to run path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) via LAMMPS.

See workflow/Overview.md for an instruction on how to obtain the Deep Potential force field, and use the LAMMPS input scripts lmp_run to run a PIMD task.
